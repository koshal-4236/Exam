                Implementation of Java Encapsulation
In Java, encapsulation is implemented by declaring instance variables as private, restricting direct access. Public getter methods retrieve variable values, while setter methods modify them, enabling controlled access. This approach allows the class to enforce data validation and maintain a consistent internal state, enhancing security and flexibility.

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

In encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of its own class.
A private class can hide its members or methods from the end user, using abstraction to hide implementation details, by combining data hiding and abstraction.
Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
It is more defined with the setter and getter method.

            <h1>FrontEnd</h1>
            <p>
                Languages for Frontend Development
Front-end is the part that is accessible to the user only, It should be self-explanatory and must be user-friendly and designed. so to achieve this we have some basic languages which can be used to create interactive web pages. These are the basic needs for the creation of a web page.

HTML: It was introduced in 1993 and currently at version HTML5, is a foundational language for creating structured web content. It facilitates the creation of forms, tables, and structured data, essential for input elements and organizing information on web pages. HTML's evolution continues to shape the internet by enabling developers to design interactive and accessible user interfaces across various platforms and devices.
CSS: CSS, introduced on 17 December 1996 and currently at version CSS3, stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It complements HTML by styling web pages, managing colors, and enabling the creation of responsive designs. CSS empowers web developers to enhance user interfaces, ensuring visually appealing and consistent layouts across different devices and screen sizes.
JavaScript: ECMAScript, introduced on 4 December 1995 and currently at version ECMAScript 2022, is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded programming language. It enables dynamic changes and event handling in web development, making it essential for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
Frontend Development Frameworks
Frameworks add more features to their respective languages. Frameworks provide extra features, structure, fast reloading, and many more things so that developers can develop a SPA(Single page application) easily. Some of them provide inbuilt functions or pre-defined components so that developer can directly use those in their projects.

jQuery : Introduced in August 2006 and now at version 3.7.1, is an open-source JavaScript library specializing in DOM manipulation, CSS editing, event handling, AJAX requests, animations, and DOM traversal. It simplifies web development by offering a streamlined approach to interactive web design and client-side scripting, enhancing user interface responsiveness across different web applications.
React : Introduced in May 2013 and now at version 18.2.0, is a JavaScript UI library designed for building SPAs. It emphasizes component-based development, efficient state management, and utilizes a virtual DOM for fast updates. React simplifies complex UI tasks, promotes code reusability, and is widely used in modern web application development.
Angular : Introduced on October 20, 2010, and currently at version 17.0.3, is an open-source JavaScript framework by Google that follows the MVC pattern. It is used for building single-page applications (SPAs), ensuring fast page reloads, and providing a modern, modular structure for web development.
Vue.js : Introduced in February 2014 and currently at version 3.3.0, is a JavaScript framework similar to ReactJS for designing UI layers. It features reactive data binding, a component-based architecture, Vue directives, and Vue Router for navigation, making it ideal for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
Bootstrap : Introduced in August 2011 and currently at version 5.3.2, is an open-source front-end framework providing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. It includes a responsive grid system, pre-styled components, and various CSS and JavaScript tools, along with customizable themes and templates for rapid web development.
Responsive Web Development
Specifies that web applications should be accessible on devices of various shapes and sizes, particularly crucial for mobile devices due to increasing traffic.

Methods for Achieving Responsiveness:

Breakpoints: Web applications adjust width and height based on device characteristics to enhance user interaction.
Flexible Images: Ensures images fit within device width, adapting using frameworks or raw CSS.
Flexible Grids: CSS grids align layouts responsively to accommodate different device sizes.
Media Queries: CSS tool defining responsive changes at specific points based on device characteristics. Query in CSS is also used to make web pages responsive. In that we describe what to change on specific point.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.

After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.

Beginner's tutorials
Your first website: Styling the content
This article provides a brief tour of what CSS is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

CSS styling basics
Our Learn web development section's CSS basics module teaches CSS fundamentals from the ground up.

CSS text styling
Here we look at fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
